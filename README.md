# BookMe-INTEC-Proyecto-de-Grado A work for the INTEC's Library cubicle reservation system update suggestion. 
# By Alexander Montolio (1072200) and Stephany M Lantigua (1072198)   


Past and Current status of the reservation system > <br/>  
For many years, the cubicle reservation process has been completely manual, which indicates that the student must go to the library and make the reservation. From an internal point of view, the library has two work shifts, morning and afternoon. This usually wouldn't cause a problem with cubicle booking, but the reality is that because of this every employee working the front desk has a user, which means the morning user has different information than the afternoon user. Therefore, when the morning employee leaves, said information is blocked and the afternoon employee must look for it with the forms filled out by hand. It should be noted that these usually get lost because they are just a few pieces of paper.<br/>  

As a result, the development of this mobile application prototype took into account the Library's policies and mandates in order to accommodate the adoption of such a new system. Finally, the concept was considered, but ultimately dismissed.<br/>   

Here's a rundown of how it works. <br/>
Login - Inserting the information regarding your account.<br/> 
Landing page - this screen will have the available reservations you can take. By selecting an available reservation, you will be able to provide your companion's information, the number of people attending, and the length of time they are staying, and for when.<br/>
The ID of the other person thats with the user is used on the ID section since primery ID is already used on the creation of the reservation taking the information from the account that's logged in.<br/> 
If User already has a reservation, a warning will let them know of it and no new reservation will be created until the currect reservation has been fulfilled.<br/>
The reservation page will show the user's active reservations from the account thats logged in. On this page you can see two more icons where the X would take the user back to the availability of reservations.<br/>  
To access this page of active reservations you must touch the small save page button :bookmark: <br/> 
By selecting the information â“˜ button you can access the page that contains brief information about the application and you can also log out by this means.
